# BloodSugarSimulator

Goal is to simulate daily blood sugar. User provides log with list of food items consumed and exercises done.
On Basis of this information we build a list of date time ranges along with the corresponding foods / exercises impacting blood sugar during those times.
Once we have this date range blood sugar impact list we could easily generate list of graph coordinates from this impact list.
